# Bug Bounties

I decided to spend a year doing bug bounties and learning about finding bugs in websites for my final year in college.

I will only post reports that **demonstrate impact**. My impact assessment is based on my experience as a bug triager for PayPal. If I would have accepted it there, I will post it here.

I mainly use HackerOne, but sometimes use BugCrowd if I want a change of pace c:
