# Bug Bounties

I decided to spend a year doing bug bounties and learning about finding bugs in websites for my final year in college.

I will be posting **both accepted and unaccepted reports**. This is mainly to document my progress, as I try to expand my own methodology, learn more about the various vulnerabilities and find more serious issues. The reports I submit will also be redacted and have some information left out.
