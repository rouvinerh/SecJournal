# SecJournal

## What's this?

This is just a compilation of notes and knowledge I gained from CTFs, courses, interning and university. Also serves as a small portfolio for me.

{% hint style="info" %}
During the semester, I am learning about Malware Development and AV/EDR evasion techniques. Will be uploading my code on Github in the future.
{% endhint %}

### Disclaimer

I do not claim to be the most correct, the best, or even remotely good at security and/or pentesting. I'm just a guy that is really into security and wants to learn as much as possible.

I do not condone any illegal activity done using any methods in this notebook. All of the concepts listed here are for **educational purposes** only. What you decide to do with these skills is on you (basically, you can't sue me, not that I was using ground-breaking techniques anyway).
