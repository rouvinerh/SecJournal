# Hello!

## Hello!

### What's this?

This is just a compilation of notes and knowledge I gained from scouring the Internet, self-practicing, going for courses, interning and learning from college. Also serves as a small portfolio for me.

#### Basic Knowledge

I wrote these when starting my journey in Infosec. It covers stuff that is more beginner-friendly to intermediate level.

**CTF:**

**Networking Knowledge:**

**Web Vulnerabilities:**

**Buffer Overflows:**

**Active Directory & Kerberos:**

#### Writeups

Here's the writeups to machines I've done on HTB or PGP (which I'm still finding the time to actually write out), and it is the **main bulk** of content here. Nowadays, I don't do as many boxes as I did in the past, but I will still do some machines because its fun to me. Also, I will try my best to take part in the new HTB Season thing.

**HackTheBox:**

**Proving Grounds Practice:**

#### Scams / Malware

Sometimes I receive some form of phishing emails, or I find malware that's being distributed on the web. I like to delve into them too, just to see how they work and how the threat actors model the scam. If there's malware, I try to reverse engineer it too.

#### In-Depth

Some of the stuff I've picked up from interning with red / pentesting teams, as well as my own research and courses done. A bit more technical and less friendly, but still the same fun.

**Defence Evasion:**

**Red Teaming and Emulation:**

{% hint style="info" %}
The Evasion and Emulation parts are a Work in Progress. Will fill it in when I have the time.
{% endhint %}

**This book will be updated as frequently as I can while juggling school work, and it is not meant to be a high-maintenance project.**

### Disclaimer

I do not claim to be the most correct, the best, or even remotely good at security and/or pentesting. I'm just a guy that is really into security and wants to learn as much as possible.

I do not condone any illegal activity done using any methods in this notebook. All of the concepts listed here are for **educational purposes** only. What you decide to do with these skills is on you (basically, you can't sue me, not that I was using ground-breaking techniques anyway).

If I wrote anything wrongly or inaccurately, please do let me know or submit a PR!
