# SecJournal

## What's this?

This is just a compilation of notes and knowledge I gained from CTFs, courses, interning and university. Also serves as a small portfolio for me.

{% hint style="info" %}
Currently, I am learning more **web stuff** in preparation for **OSWE**, which I plan to start in May during summer break.

**Malware Development** will be put on hold.
