# SecJournal

What's this?

A compilation of security related things I do and write about!

**This book will be updated as frequently as I can while juggling school work, and it is not meant to be a high-maintenance project.**

**What I am doing now (this might change!): Bug bounties and trying to get into finding bugs!**

## Disclaimer

I do not claim to be the most correct, the best, or even remotely good at security. I'm just a guy that is really into security and wants to learn as much as possible.

I do not condone any illegal activity done using any methods in this notebook. All of the concepts listed here are for **educational purposes** only. What you decide to do with these skills is on you (basically, you can't sue me, not that I was using ground-breaking techniques anyway).
