# Hello!

## What's This?

This is my notebook where I document all my security-related experiences, from HackTheBox writeups, to bug bounty findings, and personal blogs about anything information security related!&#x20;

{% hint style="warning" %}
**What am I doing now?** I have decided to spend a year on bug bounties to learn and see what I can learn and find.

## Disclaimer

I do not claim to be the most correct, the best, or even remotely good at security. I'm just a guy that is really into security and wants to learn as much as possible.

I do not condone any illegal activity done using any methods in this notebook. All of the concepts listed here are for **educational purposes** only. What you decide to do with these skills is on you (basically, you can't sue me, not that I was using ground-breaking techniques anyway).
