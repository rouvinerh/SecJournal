# Liu Hongtian

Here's another email I received.&#x20;

First thing to ask, who is Liu Hongtian? Doing a search on him doesn't tell me anything regarding NUS mail admin. Also, what's with the weird bar graph and font differences in the email?&#x20;

When visiting the website, all we see is this.

So this is another low-level scam from another credential harvesting website. When we key in some fake credentials, we get this:

Pretty much obvious that this would be receiving some kind of hit on a remote server and then probably fitting into a text file to be sold online.

We can take this a step further, and instead start to use DNS on it to see where the server's from.

Intriguing, but it looks like it was spoofed. I don't think we can host servers here, doesn't look right. Unless they have a huge boat or something, I dunno.

## Conclusion

Scam!&#x20;
