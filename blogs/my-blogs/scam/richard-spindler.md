I have made up my mind to donate this my inheritance the sum of usd10 million to the less privileged, orphanage homes, those affected by corona virus for their medical support and treatment.and then for your support and efforts to fulfill this mission, 30% of this fund will be for you, this means that upon your receipt of this fund, you will take 30% of the fund for your own personal use and compensation of your efforts.the rest 70%, you will use it to support the above-mentioned organizations as our agreement.

Such a low effort, ChatGPT copy and pasted email, so disappointing! Naturally, I replied with:

Dear Engineer Richard Spindler, 

Great to meet you! I myself identify as a devout Christian and know that God is watching too and would love to contribute to your cause. My deepest condolences on your illness, and it's great that you are doing this as your final deed.

What can I do to help? Also, do I address you as Engineer or Richard? 

Cheers.

He's not a Nigerian prince or shipping diamonds/gold so honestly, I'm having a hard time believing his cause.&#x20;

James Veitch is someone who made a TedTalk years ago (which is my favourite TedTalk to date) on replying scam emails, and I was hoping that Engineer Richard Spindler would reply, but he didnt...oh well.&#x20;
