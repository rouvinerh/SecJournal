# Web Vulnerabilities

This contains my (attempted) explanations of some web vulnerabilities, and writeups of whatever CTFs / labs / bug bounties I have done to exploit these (mainly from PortSwigger Web Academy).

Almost all website vulnerabilities are caused by the **LACK OF USER INPUT SANITISATION**. Never ever trust the user's input!

{% hint style="info" %}
Currently, I am creating writeups for the Portswigger labs, which will include an exploit script for each lab I do.

For OSWE, I will first do the SQLI, XSS, CSRF, Deserialisation, Prototype Pollution, XXE, Command Injection, Business Logic, CORS, Access Control, SSRF and SSTI labs. The rest will be done at a separate time (perhaps when I decide to head for BCSP).
