# Web Vulnerabilities

This contains my (attempted) explanations of some web vulnerabilities, and writeups of whatever CTFs / labs / bug bounties I have done to exploit these (mainly from PortSwigger Web Academy).

Almost all website vulnerabilities are caused by the **LACK OF USER INPUT SANITISATION**. Never ever trust the user's input!

As of 3 Feb 2024, I am in the midst of rewriting and updating this page with clearer explanations and what not.
