# Web Vulnerabilities

This contains my (attempted) explanations of some web vulnerabilities, and writeups of whatever CTFs / labs / bug bounties I have done to exploit these (mainly from PortSwigger Web Academy).

Almost all website vulnerabilities are caused by the **LACK OF USER INPUT SANITISATION**. Never ever trust the user's input!

{% hint style="info" %}

Currently, I am creating writeups for the Portswigger labs, which will include an exploit script where applicable.
