# Bug Bounties

In May 2025, I decided to spend a year doing bug bounties and learning about finding bugs in websites for my final year in college. This was inspired by my internship at PayPal, where I was one of the the bug triagers on HackerOne (if you've submitted a report there, I probably read it).&#x20;

I am personally amazed at the effort that researchers put into their craft, and I always  think to myself "How the heck did they find this issue?". I decided that I would like to learn it myself, so I will start hunting on VDPs before moving to Bug Bounties on the big platforms.&#x20;

I will be posting **redacted both accepted and unaccepted reports**. This is mainly to document my progress, as I try to expand my own methodology, learn more about the various vulnerabilities and find more serious issues!
