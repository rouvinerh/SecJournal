# Business Logic

## Explanation

This entire topic is all about exploiting logic flaws within a website's code due to **flawed assumptions** about the user.

This vulnerability allows attackers to manipulate an application to elicit unintended behaviour, and they are typically caused from failure to anticipate unusual application states. I feel that these kinda of vulnerabilities are a result of developers not knowing that an attacker can even manipulate their application in that way. 

One example of a logic flaw would be setting money to a negative number, thereby 'adding' money.

In general, just mess around with an application, change numbers to strings, positive integers to negative ones, and see what happens!
