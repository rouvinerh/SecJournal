# Information Security

Information Security is the practice of protecting information by mitigating risk.&#x20;

> Information Security, otherwise known as InfoSec, protects sensitive information from unauthorized acitivites, including inspection, modification, recording and any disruption or destruction.
>
> The goal is to ensure the safety and privacy of critical data, such as customer account details, financial data or intellectual property.

Generally, InfoSec has 2 distinct teams, **the red team and the blue team.** The 2 teams need to work well together to mitigate risks and reduce the attack surface of an organisation.

Red Team = Adversary, Blue Team = Defenders.

There is something called a **purple team.** What it is is basically a team of cybersecurity experts that can do both **red and blue team jobs.**&#x20;

For hackers, they can be:

* **Black-Hats,** who are your criminal hackers.&#x20;
* **White-Hats** are those that hack for good, but are law-abiding citizens and do not use their skills maliciously.&#x20;
* **Grey-Hat** hackers are those that do White-Hat hacking as their day job, and then Black-Hat hacking on their own.&#x20;
  * Grey-Hat hacking includes breaking into external systems without permissions, but without any malicious intent or motive.&#x20;
* **Hacktivist**
  * People like Anonymous, who hack to promote social agendas and beliefs.
  * Hacks include defacing websites, doxxing certain people by revealing information and so on.
* **State-Sponsored Threats**
  * Elite hackers that are feared by other nations.
  * The weapons for digital wars.
* **Script Kiddies**
  * People that are completely unskilled, running scripts, tools and software developed by real hackers.
  * They do very little damage, since they are unable to understand the things they are even doing.
  * Intent to learn is missing, and they don't do much.
* **Red Hat Hackers**
  * These are hackers who are similar to white hat hackers, with the similar goal to stop black-hats from succeeding.
  * However, they are willing to break the law and are more ruthless in achieving their goal.
* **Green Hat Hackers**
  * Amateur hackers, but with a clear intention to learn, separating them from script kiddies.
  * Aim is to become full-fledged and experienced hackers.

Information Security is a rich and diverse field with many different specialisations, as with all sectors of IT. Take your pick!
