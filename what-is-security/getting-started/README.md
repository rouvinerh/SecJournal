# Getting Started

### Author's Note

There's no need to know everything on this list before even starting in security! This is just a compilation of whatever I feel is useful. I picked these up as I went along. Personally, I started doing security stuff after bits of networking and some basic C coding. This section is a bit more personalized.

### Programming

Programming should be a fundamental no matter which area of computing you're in. For pentesting, we do need to know code and stuff. I think that these few concepts are key if you want to get into this.&#x20;

* **Javascript** for understanding websites
* **Python** for scripting exploits
* **C/ C++** for understanding how manual memory and stack control works
* **Bash** for Linux
* **Powershell** for Windows
* **Basic SQL** for enumerating databases and carrying out basic functions&#x20;
* **C#** for the .NET framework
* **Assembly** for reverse engineering and low-level stuff

I personally didn't start with a ton of coding knowledge, just the real bare basics of for loops, recursions and stuff in C, and learnt more as I went along. If you're new to programming, I recommend starting with C. Coding in C is like driving a manual car, once you can get good at that, then any auto car (like Python) will become really easy.

### Networking

Networking is definitely one of the backbones of any security job. Understanding the basics, like routing, protocols, and the OSI Model may be applicable for you.

**Understanding how these work is key to exploiting them!** I recommend the **Cisco Certified Network Associate**. It's an entry-level networking certification, and although it does not go as in-depth, it's a good starting point for networking.&#x20;

### Operating Systems

Understanding how the computer works would be key in spotting vulnerabilities. Generally, we need to understand how the Windows and Linux systems functions, where the important files are, and how they are usually configured. I don't think one needs to know how to code an OS from start to finish, but just a rough general understanding would do.
