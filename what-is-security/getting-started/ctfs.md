# CTFs

## CTFs

Capture-The-Flags (CTF) are computer security competitions. The most common type of CTF is Jeopardy, consisting of individual challenges with varying points. The goal of each challenge is to find a string of text known as the flag, like `flag{thisisaflag}`. The team that solves the most challenges and has the most points wins.

### Challenge Types

1. Web
   * Enumerate, scan and hack a website to get the flag!
2. Forensics
   * Analysis of a file, such as disk files, log files or Wireshark packet captures to find hidden information.
   * Steganography is technically part of this, and that involves finding hidden information in images.
3. Pwn / Binary Exploitation
   * Exploitation of a program running on a server by connecting to it, then sending a specific input to gain control via variations of buffer overflows.
   * The program that is running is given (`.exe` or `.elf`).
4. Cryptography
   * Exploitation of an incorrectly implemented algorithm, such as RSA, to decrypt information.
5. Reverse Engineering
   * Given a program or file, find out how it works and reverse engineer it to find exploitable vulnerabilities.
6. Misc.
   * Could be anything, such as random scripting, OSINT, or knowledge tests on operating systems.

CTFs are insanely fun, and it's a great way to start cybersecurity. It's how I started too.
