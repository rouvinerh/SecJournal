# CTFs

## CTFs

Capture-The-Flags (CTF) are computer security competitions that test one's cybersecurity knowledge. The most common type of CTF is Jeopardy style, consisting of individual challenges with varying points. The goal of each challenge is to find a string of text known as the flag, like `flag{this\_is\_a\_fak3\_flag}`.  The team that solves the most challenges and has the most points win!

### Challenge Types

1. Web
   * Enumerate, scan and hack a website to get the flag!

2. Forensics
   * Analysis of a file, such as a disk file, log files or Wireshark packet captures to find hidden information.
   * Steganography is technically part of this, and that involves finding hidden information in images.

3. Pwn / Binary Exploitation
   * Exploitation of a binary running on a server by connecting to the server and sending a specific input to gain control of the server.
   * The program that is running  is given (`.exe` or `.elf`).
   * Decompile, fuzz and reverse engineer the program to find vulnerabilities to exploit.

4. Cryptography
   * Exploitation of an incorrectly implemented algorithm to decrypt the flag.
   * Involves math.

5. Reverse Engineering
   * Self-explanatory. Given a program or file, find out how it works and reverse engineer it to find exploitable vulnerabilities.&#x20;

6. Misc.
   * Could be anything! The most wildcard of all the challenges.&#x20;
   * Open Source Intelligence Gathering (OSINT), which is basically intense Googling is sometimes  here, if not a category on its own. 

CTFs are insanely fun and one can learn a lot from doing them. It's a great way to start cybersecurity.

## Note

Apart from taking part in CTFs, **do ensure to read lots of writeups as well**. Learning how other people approach challenges and the methodologies they use to solve them can help you better improve your own methods. **IT IS OKAY TO REFER TO THE ANSWERS**.
