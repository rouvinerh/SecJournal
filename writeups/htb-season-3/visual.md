## Gaining Access

Pretty fun, learnt quite a bit. The initial errors were pretty frustrating, but eventually I understood why it happened.

Here are some hints:

* The box name and OS hints towards a certain software.
* Think about what attributes you can modify within the files you create and whether you can trigger the event you want. It's pretty well documented.
* If you are facing errors, think about how your files are being accessed.

## Privilege Escalation

Rather fast, I was initially stumped for a bit but eventually realised I overlooked something painfully obvious and wasted about 40 minutes.

* Think about which user is doing what.
* Once you are a certain user, the rest of the escalation is simple.
