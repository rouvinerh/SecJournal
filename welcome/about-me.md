# About Me

## Hello!

My name is Rouvin. I like breaking stuff, and am really into cybersecurity.

I made this book to document my own learning and compile my knowledge. It doubles as a small portfolio for me. 

There's loads of free stuff on the Internet in general, and security is definitely part of that. I'd like to thank all the authors and experts that share knowledge online for everyone to learn from! I would have never have learned so much without them.

## Bio

* I am currently a sophomore majoring in Information Security at National University of Singapore (NUS), and will graduate in 2026.
* Current Certifications:
    * **OffSec Certified Professional (OSCP)**
    * **Certified Red Team Operator (CRTO)** from Zero-Point Security
    * **Certified Red Team Expert (CRTE)** from Altered Security
    * **eLearnSecurity Junior Penetration Tester (eJPT)** from INE
    * **Cisco Certified Network Associate 200-301 (CCNA)**
    * **CompTIA Security+**
* I can speak English and Chinese (although the latter isn't the best).
* I really enjoy reading about how stuff is exploited and exploiting things myself (legally).
* Apart from security, I enjoy water sports. Currently, I'm a canoe sprint athlete representing NUS.
* I enjoy teaching too. Currently I work as a cybersecurity instructor and was a canoe sprint coach in the past.

## Obligatory Disclaimer (Again)

I do not claim to be the most correct, the best, or even remotely good at security. I'm just a guy that is really into security and wants to learn as much as possible.

I do not condone any illegal activity done using any methods in this notebook. All of the concepts listed here are for **educational purposes** only. What you decide to do with these skills is on you (basically, you can't sue me, not that I was using ground-breaking techniques anyway).
