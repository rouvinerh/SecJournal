# About Me

## Hello!

My name is Rouvin. I like breaking stuff, and am really into cybersecurity.

I created this space to document my own security learning and projects. It doubles as a small portfolio for me.

There's loads of free stuff on the Internet in general, and security is definitely part of that. I'd like to thank all the authors and experts that share knowledge online for everyone (including me) to learn from!

## Bio

* I am currently a sophomore majoring in Information Security at National University of Singapore (NUS), and will graduate in 2026.
* Current Certifications:
    * **OffSec Certified Professional (OSCP)**
    * **Certified Red Team Operator (CRTO)** from Zero-Point Security
    * **Certified Red Team Expert (CRTE)** from Altered Security
    * **eLearnSecurity Junior Penetration Tester (eJPT)** from INE
    * **Cisco Certified Network Associate 200-301 (CCNA)**
    * **CompTIA Security+**
* I can speak English and Chinese (although the latter isn't the best).
* I enjoy reading about how stuff is exploited and exploiting things myself in my free time (legally, of course).
* Outside of security, I am a canoe sprint athlete. I represent NUS in varsity competitions and currently am a national athlete representing Singapore.
* I enjoy teaching too, and teach cybersecurity to youths in the Sentinel Programme by the Digital and Intelligence Service (DIS) on the weekends. Prior to that, I was a canoe sprint coach for National Junior College.

## Obligatory Disclaimer (Again)

I do not claim to be the most correct, the best, or even remotely good at security. I'm just a guy that is really into security and wants to learn as much as possible.

I do not condone any illegal activity done using any methods in this notebook. All of the concepts listed here are for **educational purposes** only. What you decide to do with these skills is on you (basically, you can't sue me, not that I was using ground-breaking techniques anyway).
