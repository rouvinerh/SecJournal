# About Me

## Hello!

My name is Rouvin. I love breaking things and am really into cybersecurity. Since childhood, I've been fascinated by technology, often taking apart computers and old phones physically, then wondering how it works. I always put things back together in the wrong order to see if it still turns on. This curiosity, along with a tendency to break the rules (much to my parents' dismay), naturally led me to a career in security and hacking.

I created this blog to document my own security learning and projects from university, internships or certification courses. I was inspired by the many authors and security professionals who share their knowledge online for free. Thank you for allowing me learn from you!

## Bio

* I am a penultimate student majoring in Information Security at National University of Singapore (NUS) in the School of Computing, and will graduate in 2026.
* Current Certifications:
    * **OffSec Certified Professional (OSCP)**
    * **Certified Red Team Operator (CRTO)** from Zero-Point Security

* Outside of security, I am a canoe sprint athlete. I represent NUS in varsity competitions and currently am a national athlete representing Singapore.

I do not claim to be the most correct, the best, or even remotely good at security. I'm just a guy that is really into security and wants to learn as much as possible.
