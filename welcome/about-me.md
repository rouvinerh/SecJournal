# About Me

## Hello!

My name is Rouvin. I like breaking stuff, and am really into cybersecurity.

The point of this book is to document whatever I've done regarding cybersecurity for reference in future or just to look back upon.

There's loads of free stuff on the Internet in general, and security is definitely part of that. I'd like to thank all the authors and experts that share knowledge online for everyone to learn from! I would have never have learned so much without them.

The motivation to create this book is to giveback to the community which I have had a lot of help from (If you helped me before, thank you!). This book aims to (hopefully) help someone start out on their cybersecurity journey, or to perhaps teach others something new! Whether you're in tech or not, I hope you can learn something from here :D

## Bio

* I am currently a sophomore majoring in Information Security at National University of Singapore (NUS), and will graduate in 2026.
* Current Certifications: **CRTO, CRTE, OSCP, eJPT, CCNA, Security+.**
* I can speak English and Chinese (although the latter isn't the best).
* I really enjoy reading about how stuff is exploited and exploiting things myself (legally).
* Apart from security, I enjoy water sports. Currently, I'm a canoe sprint athlete representing NUS and am a canoe coach.

## Obligatory Disclaimer (Again)

I do not claim to be the most correct, the best, or even remotely good at security and/or pentesting. I'm just a guy that is really into security and wants to learn as much as possible.

I do not condone any illegal activity done using any methods in this notebook. All of the concepts listed here are for **educational purposes** only. What you decide to do with these skills is on you (basically, you can't sue me, not that I was using ground-breaking techniques anyway).
